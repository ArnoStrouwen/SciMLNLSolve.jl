SciMLNLSolve.jl is a wrapper library for bringing external Julia nonlinear solver
libraries into the SciML common interface. With this you can currently
add the following libraries to your nonlinear solving:

- [NLsolve.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/NLsolve.jl)
- [MINPACK.jl](https://github.com/sglyon/MINPACK.jl)
